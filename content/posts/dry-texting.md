## Definition

**Dry texting** refers to a style of messaging where replies are short, low-effort, or lack emotional engagement, often making a conversation feel forced or one-sided.

## Meaning and Usage

Dry texting usually involves brief responses such as “ok,” “yeah,” or “lol,” without follow-up questions or enthusiasm. While not always intentional, it is commonly interpreted as disinterest, emotional distance, or lack of investment in the conversation.

## Origin

The term emerged alongside smartphone messaging and dating apps, where conversational tone must be inferred from text alone.

## Examples

- *She stopped asking questions and started dry texting.*
- *Dry texting can make people feel ignored.*
